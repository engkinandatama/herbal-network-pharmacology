# MD Simulation Input Files - Luteolin_PDE5A

## Complex
- **Compound**: Luteolin
- **Target**: PDE5A
- **PDB ID**: 1TBF

## Files
- `PDE5A_1TBF.pdb` - Receptor structure (clean)
- `Luteolin_docked.pdb` - Ligand (best docking pose)

## Usage
1. Upload this folder as a Kaggle dataset
2. Update paths in the MD simulation notebook
3. Run the notebook

## Notes
- Ligand is extracted from the best docking pose (-9.53 kcal/mol for PPARG)
- Receptor has been cleaned (remove waters, ions, heteroatoms)
